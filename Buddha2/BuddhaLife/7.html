                  The
                  king did everything he could think of to ensure his son
                  Prince Siddhartha would grow up prepared for a life following in
                  his own footsteps and become a king. He ordered a high
                  wall to be built around the palace, including its parks
                  and gardens, but the prince was not happy living like
                  a prisoner. One day he told his father, "I must go
                  out of the palace gate and see how other people live."

                  "Very
                  well, my son," said the king, "you shall go outside
                  the palace wall to see how people live in my city. But
                  first I must prepare things, so that all would be good
                  and proper for my noble son's visit."

                  The
                  king ordered the people of the city to prepare for his
                  son's visit by making the streets and homes beautiful
                  and welcoming him as he passed them by. When the people
                  had decorated the city the king said, "Now you can
                  go, my dear son, and see the city as you please."

                  As
                  the young prince was going through the streets all of
                  a sudden, from a small old hut beside the road, out came
                  an old man with long silver-grey hair, wearing very old,
                  torn and dirty rags. The skin of his face was dried and
                  wrinkled. His sunken eyes were dim and he was almost blind.
                  There were no teeth in his mouth. He stood up, trembling
                  all over, almost bent over double and clutching at a shaking
                  stick with two bent and skinny hands to save himself from
                  falling.

                  The
                  old beggar dragged himself along the street, paying no
                  attention to all the happy people around him. He was speaking
                  very feebly, begging people around him to give him food,
                  as he would die that very day if he could find nothing
                  to eat. When the prince saw the old man, he didn't know
                  what he was looking at. It was the first time in his life
                  that he had seen an old man of this type.

                  "What
                  is that, Channa?" he asked his driver. "That
                  really cannot be a man! Why is he all bent? What is he
                  trembling for? Why is his hair silver-grey, not black
                  like mine? What is wrong with his eyes? Where are his
                  teeth? Is this how some people are born? Tell me, oh
                  good Channa, what does this mean?"

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
                  Channa
                  told the prince that it was an old man and he was not
                  born like that. "When young he was like us and now,
                  due to his old age he has become this way." Channa
                  told the prince to forget this man. But the prince was
                  not satisfied. "Everyone in the world, if he lives
                  long enough, becomes like this man. It cannot be stopped,"
                  said Channa.

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
                  The
                  prince ordered Channa to drive back home at once, as he
                  was very sad and wanted to think carefully about that
                  terrible thing called old age.

          <p>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
                  That
                  night there was a grand royal feast for the prince, but
                  he was not interested or happy at all during the dinner
                  and dance. He was thinking all the time, "Some day
                  you will all grow old and frail and bent — every
                  one of you, even the prettiest."

          <p>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
                  He
                  could not sleep when night came. He was in bed thinking
                  that one day, everyone would grow old, grey, wrinkled,
                  toothless and ugly like the old beggar. He wanted to know
                  if anyone had found a way to stop this horrible thing
                  — old age.

                  The
                  king, when he heard this story, was very sad and worried
                  that his son would leave the palace. He told his attendants
                  to put on more dances and dinners. But the prince begged
                  his father to allow him to see Kapilavatthu on an ordinary
                  day without the people being told of his visit.
