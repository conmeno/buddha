                        ten months after her dream of a white elephant and the 
                        sign that she would give birth to a great leader, Queen 
                        Maya was expecting her child. One day she went to the 
                        king and said, "My dear, I have to go back to my 
                        parents. My baby is almost due." Since it was the 
                        custom in India for a wife to have her baby in her father's 
                        house, the king agreed, saying, "Very well, I will 
                        make the necessary arrangements for you to go."</font></div>

                        king then sent soldiers ahead to clear the road and prepared 
                        others to guard the queen as she was carried in a decorated 
                        palanquin. The queen left Kapilavatthu in a long procession 
                        of soldiers and retainers, headed for the capital of her 
                        father's kingdom.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On 
                        the way to the Koliya country, the great procession passed 
                        a garden called Lumbini Park. This garden was near the 
                        kingdom called Nepal, at the foot of the Himalayan mountains. 
                        The beautiful park with its sala trees and scented flowers 
                        and busy birds and bees attracted the queen. Since the 
                        park was a good resting place, the queen ordered the bearers 
                        to stop for a while. As she rested underneath one of the 
                        sala trees, her birth began and a baby boy was born. It 
                        was an auspicious day. The birth took place on a full 
                        moon (which is now celebrated as Vesak, the festival of 
                        the triple event of Buddha's birth, enlightenment and 
                        death), in the year 623 B.C.</font></p>

                        to the legends about this birth, the baby began to walk 
                        seven steps forward and at each step a lotus flower appeared 
                        on the ground. Then, at the seventh stride, he stopped 
                        and with a noble voice shouted:</font></p>
