                  Now at the time, in a
                  nearby village called Senani, there lived a young,
                  very beautiful and rich girl called Sujata, who wanted
                  a husband of equal rank and a son. She had waited
                  for many years and she was not successful. The people
                  told her that she must go to certain banyan tree near
                  the Neranjara river and pray to the tree-god to give
                  her a husband and son. She did as the people told
                  her and later on she got married to a young man and
                  they had a lovely son. She was extremely happy and
                  decided to fulfil her vow to the tree-god for giving
                  her all that she had asked for.

              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Sujata had a thousand
                  cows, and she fed them with sweet creepers called valmee
                  so that the cow’s milk was sweet. She milked
                  these thousand cows and fed that milk to five hundred
                  cows, and then fed their milk to two hundred and fifty
                  cows and so on until she fed only eight cows. She
                  did this to get the sweetest and most nourishing milk,
                  to make delicious milk-rice as an offering to
                  the tree-god.

              <p>
                  As she was doing this she was surprised
                  to see her servant running back from cleaning and
                  preparing the area at the foot of the banyan tree.
                  Very happy and excited, the servant said, "My
                  lady Sujata! The banyan god is meditating at the foot
                  of the tree. How lucky you must be to have the god
                  in person to accept your food."
              </p>
          </font>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Sujata too was happy
                  and excited and danced with joy with the servant.
                  They then took even more pains to prepare the milk-rice,
                  pouring it into a golden bowl.

              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Taking the delicious
                  milk-rice both of them went to the banyan tree and
                  Sujata saw what she perceived to be a holy man. He
                  was handsome and golden looking and sat serenely in
                  meditation. She did not know that he was in fact Ascetic
                  Gotama. She bowed with respect and said, "Lord,
                  accept my donation of milk-rice. May you be successful
                  in obtaining your wishes as I have been."

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Ascetic Gotama ate the
                  sweet thick milk-rice and then bathed in the river
                  Neranjara. This was the last food and bath he would
                  have for seven weeks. When he finished he took the
                  golden bowl and threw it in the river, saying, "If
                  I am to succeed in becoming a Buddha today, let this
                  bowl go upstream, but if not, let it go downstream."
                  The golden bowl went upstream, all the while keeping
                  in the middle of the river.
