                  On
                  the seventh day after the Buddha's homecoming Princess
                  Yasodhara dressed up young Rahula. The Buddha's son
                  had been brought up by his mother and grandfather
                  and was now seven years old. She pointed to the Buddha
                  and said, "That is your father, Rahula. Go and
                  ask him for your inheritance."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Innocent
                  Rahula went to the Buddha and, looking up into his
                  face, told him what his mother had asked him to say,
                  adding, "Father, even your shadow is pleasing
                  to me."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  As
                  the Buddha left the palace Rahula followed him saying,
                  "Give me my inheritance." Coming to the
                  park the Buddha thought, "He desires his father's
                  wealth, but this goes with the worldly life and is
                  full of trouble and suffering. I shall instead give
                  him what I know and thus give him an excellent inheritance."
                  The Buddha then asked Sariputta, one of his disciples,
                  to ordain Rahula.

                  When
                  King Suddhodana heard that his beloved grandson had
                  become a monk he was deeply grieved. The king said,
                  "When you left home it made me sad. When Nanda
                  left home my heart ached. I concentrated my love on
                  my grandson and again the one I love has left me.
                  Please do not ordain anyone without their parent's
                  permission." To this the Buddha agreed and never
                  ordained anybody after that without their parents'
                  permission.
