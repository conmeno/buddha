              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  At this time in India there
                  were many religious teachers. One of the best and most
                  well known was Alara Kalama. Ascetic Gotama went
                  to study under him. He stayed and was taught many things,
                  including meditation. He worked hard and eventually equalled
                  his teacher in learning. Finally Alara Kalama could not
                  teach Gotama any more and he said, "You are the same
                  as I am now. There is no difference between us. Stay here
                  and take my place and teach my students with me."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  But Gotama was not interested
                  in staying. Despite what he had learnt he could see that
                  he was still subject to old age, sickness, and death and
                  that his quest was not over.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Thus, Gotama left Alara Kalama
                  and went in search of a new teacher. At last he found
                  another great teacher, Uddaka, who was famous for his cleverness.
                  Again, Gotama learnt very quickly and soon
                  knew as much as his teacher. He found that Uddaka
                  could not teach him how to stop suffering, old age
                  and death either, and he had never heard of anyone who could solve
                  these problems. Once again the Ascetic Gotama was disappointed
                  and left Uddaka, making up his mind to struggle by himself
                  until he found the cause of all the suffering of life.
