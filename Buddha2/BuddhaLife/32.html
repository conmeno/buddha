                  One
                  day the Buddha visited a monastery. While he was there he came
                  across a chamber where a monk lay in great pain
                  caused by a loathsome disease. Although there were many
                  other monks at the monastery, not one of them was
                  concerned about their sick brother. The Buddha,
                  beholding this woeful situation, began to look after
                  the suffering man. He called Ananda and together
                  they bathed the monk, changed his dirty bed and
                  eased his pain.

                  Then
                  the Buddha admonished the monks of the monastery
                  for their neglect and encouraged them to nurse the
                  sick and care for the suffering. He concluded by
                  saying, "Whosoever serves the sick and suffering,
                  serves me."
