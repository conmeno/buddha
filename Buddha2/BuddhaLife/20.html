                  This
                  discourse was given to the five ascetics who were his former
                  companions, at the Deer Park in Isipatana (now called Sarnath),
                  near Benares, India. Many devas and brahmas (angels and gods)

                  The
                  Buddha started the discourse by advising the five ascetics
                  to give up two extremes. These were indulgence in sensual
                  pleasures and the tormenting of the body (self-indulgence
                  and self-mortification).

                  He
                  advised against too much sensual pleasure because these pleasures
                  were base, worldly, not noble and unhelpful in spiritual development.
                  On the other hand, tormenting the body was painful, not noble
                  and also unhelpful in spiritual development. He advised them
                  to follow the Middle Way, which is helpful in seeing things
                  clearly, as they are, and in attaining knowledge, higher wisdom,
                  peace, and enlightenment or nirvana.

                  The
                  Buddha then taught the five ascetics the Four Noble Truths.
                  They are: the truth of suffering; its cause; its end; and
                  the way to its end. Everything in this world is full of suffering,
                  and the cause of suffering is craving. The end of suffering
                  is nirvana. The way to the end of suffering is via the Noble
                  Eightfold Path.
