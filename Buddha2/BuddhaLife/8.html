                  The
                  king very unwillingly allowed the prince to visit the
                  city a second time. He thought it would do no good to
                  try to stop him, and would only add to his confusion and unhappiness.
                  On his second visit to the city the king did not warn
                  the people to be ready or to prepare the streets. The
                  prince and Channa dressed up as young men from noble families
                  so the people would not know them.

                  When
                  they arrived, the city was quite different to
                  their last visit. No more joyous crowds of people hailed
                  the prince. There were no flags, bunting, flowers or well-dressed
                  people, but simple folk going about their daily work to
                  earn a living. A blacksmith was sweating and pounding
                  to make knives. The jewellers and goldsmiths were making
                  necklaces, bangles, earrings and rings out of diamonds,
                  gold and silver. The clothes-dyers were dyeing cloths
                  of lovely colour and hanging them up to dry. The bakers
                  were busily baking bread, cakes and sweets and selling
                  them to the customers, who ate them still hot. The prince
                  looked at these simple common people. Everyone was very
                  busy, happy and pleased in their work.

                  As
                  the two walked along they came across a man on the ground,
                  twisting his body, holding his stomach with both hands
                  and crying out in pain at the top of his voice. All over
                  his face and body were purple patches, his eyes were rolling,
                  and he was gasping for breath.

                  For
                  the second time in his life something made the prince
                  very sad. At once the prince, being a very kind person
                  and not liking to see people distressed, ran forward and
                  rested the man's head on his knee, saying, " What
                  is wrong with you? What is wrong?" The sick man could
                  not speak, but only cry.

                  "Channa,
                  tell me why this man is like this," said the
                  prince. "What is the matter with his breath? Why
                  does he not talk?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Oh,
                  my prince," said Channa, "do not hold this man
                  like that. This man is sick. His blood is poisoned. He
                  has plague fever and it is burning all over his body.
                  That is why he is crying loudly without being able to
                  speak."

                  "But
                  are there any other men like this?" asked the prince.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Yes,
                  and you may be the next if you hold the man as close as
                  that. Please put him down and do not touch him or the
                  plague will come out of him and go to you. You will become
                  the same as he is."

              <p>
                  "Yes, my prince, there are hundreds of other sicknesses as painful
                  as this," replied Channa.
              </p>
          </font>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Can
                  no one help it? Will everyone be sick? Can it happen at
                  any time by surprise?" asked Siddhartha.
              </font>

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Yes,
                  my dear prince," said Channa, "everyone in this
                  world. No one can stop it and it can happen any time.
                  Anyone may fall ill and suffer."

                  The
                  prince was even sadder as he returned to the palace the
                  second time, dwelling on the man and his sickness.
