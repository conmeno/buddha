                  In
                  Savatthi there was a scavenger named Sunita. He
                  was a road-sweeper and barely earned enough to feed
                  himself. Sunita slept on the roadside, for he did
                  not have a house to go to. He saw other people enjoying
                  themselves but he could not mix with them because
                  these people called him an outcast. Whenever a higher
                  caste person went on the road Sunita had to run
                  and hide so his shadow did not fall on them. If
                  he was not quick enough he would be scolded and
                  beaten. Poor Sunita lived a miserable life.

                  One
                  day, as he was sweeping a dirty, dusty road, Sunita
                  saw the Buddha with thousands of followers coming
                  towards him. His heart was filled with joy and fear
                  and finding no place to hide he just stood, joining
                  his palms in respect. The Buddha stopped and spoke
                  to poor Sunita in a sweet, gentle voice saying, "My
                  dear friend, would you like to leave this work and
                  follow me?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Nobody
                  had ever spoken to Sunita like this before. His
                  heart was filled with joy and his eyes with tears.
                  "O, most venerable Sir, I have always received
                  orders but never a kind word. If you accept a dirty
                  and miserable scavenger like me I will follow you."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  So
                  the Buddha ordained Sunita and took him along with
                  the other monks. From that day forth no one knew
                  what Sunita's caste was, and nobody treated him
                  with disgust and cruelty. Everybody, even kings,
                  ministers and commanders, respected him.
