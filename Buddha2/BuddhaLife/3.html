                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">King Suddhodana 
                    had an old teacher who was known to be very wise. He was called 
                    Asita the Sage. Asita lived in the jungle. While sitting one 
                    day he heard the devas singing and saw them dancing. "Why 
                    are you so happy?" he asked. "Because the most excellent 
                    of all beings has been born at Lumbini Park to Queen Maha 
                    Maya," replied the devas. When he heard this, Asita went 
                    quickly to see the king and queen and their newborn son.</font></div>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 
                    king was very happy to see his wise old teacher again. In 
                    the palace, after the sage was seated, the king brought the 
                    prince before him and said, "Teacher, my son was born 
                    only yesterday. Here he is. Please see if his future will 
                    be good."</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As 
                    the king said this, he lowered the infant prince before the 
                    sage so that he might examine him properly. However, the baby 
                    turned his feet on to the sage's head. Thus surprised, Asita 
                    took hold of the baby's feet and examined them very carefully, 
                    finding some marks on them. He got up and said, "This 
                    prince will become a very great teacher in this world." 
                    The sage was very pleased and, putting his palms together, 
                    paid due respect to the baby prince. The king, seeing this, 
                    did the same. This was the first salutation of the king.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On 
                    the fifth day of his son's life, the king invited five wise 
                    men to witness the naming ceremony and to suggest a good name 
                    for the prince. The wise men examined the birthmarks of the 
                    prince and concluded, "The prince will be King of Kings 
                    if he wants to rule. If he chooses a religious life then he 
                    will become the Wisest â€” the Buddha."</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 
                    youngest of the five wise men, Kondanna, then said, "This 
                    prince will be the Buddha and nothing else."</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Then 
                    the wise men gave him the name Siddhartha meaning "wish-fulfilled" 
                    or "one who has accomplished his goal".</font></p>
