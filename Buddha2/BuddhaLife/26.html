                  Near
                  Rajagaha there were two villages called Upatissa
                  and Kolita. The headmen of these two villages were
                  also known as Upatissa and Kolita. Both families
                  were very close friends.

                  One
                  day Upatissa's wife, Sari, gave birth to a son called
                  Sariputta. On the same day Kolita's wife, Moggali,
                  also gave birth to a son called Moggallana. The
                  sons became best friends.

                  When
                  they grew up both of them liked to watch dramas.
                  One day, while watching a drama called Giragga Samapujja
                  (The Mountain Festival), the young boys decided
                  to leave home in order to seek greater happiness
                  and understanding of life than could be had by watching
                  plays.

                  Now
                  at this time there was a famous religious teacher
                  called Sanjaya staying near Rajagaha. The two friends
                  went to learn from him, but after a while they found
                  his teachings unsatisfactory and left. They promised
                  each other they would both continue searching, studying
                  and meditating in an effort to find the truth about
                  life, and that whoever found it first would let the other
                  know.

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  One
                  morning, in the main street of Rajagaha, Sariputta
                  saw the ascetic Assaji begging for alms. He radiated
                  modesty and calmness as he went from house to house.
                  As Sariputta came closer he saw on Assaji's face
                  a look of perfect peace, like a smooth undisturbed
                  lake under a calm clear sky. Sariputta went up to
                  him and humbly said, "Your face, friend, is
                  serene. Your eyes so clear and bright. Who is your
                  teacher and what does he teach, Sir?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "I
                  can soon tell you that, brother," replied Assaji.
                  "There is a great ascetic of the Sakya race
                  who has left his home and country behind in order
                  to follow the homeless life. He is my teacher and
                  it is his teaching that I follow and practise."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Please
                  tell me more."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "I
                  am only a newcomer to the way of the Buddha,"
                  replied the ascetic modestly. "I do not know
                  very much yet. But I will give you a brief description."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "That
                  is all I want, brother," said Sariputta quickly.
                  "Tell me the meaning of the teachings. Why
                  make a lot of words about it?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Very
                  well then," said the ascetic. "Listen!
                  The Buddha teaches that there is a cause for everything,
                  and also how things cease to be."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  After
                  the Venerable Assaji spoke these lines, Sariputta
                  was so clever that he understood their meaning.
                  He realised the truth that everything that ever
                  has come into existence, or will come into existence,
                  must pass away. He said, "If this is what the
                  Buddha teaches you have found the state that is
                  free from sorrow and suffering and full of peace
                  and happiness." After thanking Assaji, Sariputta
                  went to find his friend Moggallana to bring him
                  the great news.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Before
                  he spoke a word Moggallana cried, "Why brother,
                  how clear and shining your face is. Can it be that
                  at last you have found what we have been seeking?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "It
                  is so, brother, it is so," was Sariputta's glad
                  reply, and he explained the Buddha's teachings to
                  him.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Thus,
                  Sariputta and Moggallana joined the Buddha and in
                  a short time became two of his chief disciples.
                  Sariputta became known for his wisdom and Moggallana
                  for his miraculous power.
