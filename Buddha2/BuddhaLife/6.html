                  The
                  five wise men who were at Prince Siddhartha's naming ceremony
                  not only predicted the great future of the new prince,
                  but had given the king a warning. "When your son
                  sees a sick man, an old man, a dead body and a monk, he
                  will want to leave the palace and become a monk himself,"
                  they had said.

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  These
                  words worried the king. He became afraid that this son
                  would see these four sights and leave the palace. To shield
                  Siddhartha from any such experiences he employed many
                  young servants to distract and protect him, and did not
                  allow any sick or old people or monks to go into the palace.
                  He built Siddhartha three palaces: one for winter, one
                  for summer and one for the rainy season, as well as enclosed
                  parks and hunting grounds.

                  Siddhartha
                  played in a sunny world of gardens and groves, attended
                  by dancing girls and musicians. He lived in a world of
                  plenty and beauty. He could have whatever he wanted, yet
                  he was not happy.

                  One
                  day the king asked some wise people, "What shall
                  I do to make my son happy? He seems depressed and sad
                  always." They answered, "Now your son is sixteen
                  years old, why not find him a beautiful girl to marry?"

                  The
                  king agreed and sent for all the beautiful girls in the
                  country to come to the palace. When they had all arrived,
                  a grand parade was arranged and the king asked the prince
                  to choose one to be his wife.

                  Among
                  them there was a most charming and kind girl by the name
                  of Yasodhara. When Prince Siddhartha gave her a present
                  more valuable than any he had given to the other maidens,
                  the king saw that the prince had chosen his love. The
                  king happily accepted Yasodhara and allowed his son to
                  marry her.
