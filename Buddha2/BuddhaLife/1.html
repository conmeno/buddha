                        than 2,500 years ago, there was a king called Suddhodana. 
                        He married a beautiful Koliyan princess named Maha Maya. 
                        The couple ruled over the Sakyas, a warrior tribe living 
                        next to the Koliya tribe, in the north of India, in what 
                        is now known as Nepal. The capital of the Sakya country 
                        was laid out across the foothills of the Himalayas and 
                        called Kapilavatthu.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Queen 
                        Maha Maya was the daughter of King Anjana of the Koliyas. 
                        Such was her beauty that the name Maya, meaning "vision"
                        was given to her. But it was Maya's virtues and talents 
                        that were her most wonderful qualities, for she was endowed 
                        with the highest gifts of intelligence and piety. King 
                        Suddhodana was indeed worthy of his lovely wife. He himself 
                        was called "King of the Law" because he ruled according 
                        to the law. There was no other man among the Sakyas more 
                        honored and respected. The king was admired by his nobles 
                        and courtiers, as well as by the householders and merchants. 
                        Such was the noble family from which the Buddha was to 
                        arise.</font></p>

                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">One 
                        full moon night, sleeping in the palace, the queen had 
                        a vivid dream. She felt herself being carried away by 
                        four devas (spirits) to Lake Anotatta in the Himalayas. 
                        After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in 
                        heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and bedecked 
                        her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, 
                        holding a white lotus flower in its trunk, appeared and 
                        went round her three times, entering her womb through 
                        her right side. Finally the elephant disappeared and the 
                        queen awoke, knowing she had been delivered an important 
                        message, as the elephant is a symbol of greatness in Nepal. 
                        The next day, early in the morning, the queen told the 
                        king about the dream. The king was puzzled and sent for 
                        some wise men to discover the meaning of the dream.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 
                        wise men said, "Your Majesty, you are very lucky. The 
                        devas have chosen our queen as the mother of the Purest-One 
                        and the child will become a very great being." The king 
                        and queen were very happy when they heard this.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">They 
                        were so pleased that they invited many of the noblemen 
                        in the country to the palace to a feast to tell them the 
                        good news. Even the needy were not forgotten. Food and 
                        clothes were given to the poor people in celebration. 
                        The whole kingdom waited eagerly for the birth of the 
                        new prince, and Queen Maya enjoyed a happy and healthy 
                        pregnancy, living a pure life for herself and her unborn 
                        child.</font></p>
