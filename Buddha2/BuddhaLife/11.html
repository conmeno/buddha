                  The
                  king, Siddhartha's father, arranged a grand dinner and
                  dance for the prince to celebrate the birth of Rahula.
                  Invited were the best dancers, singers and musicians
                  in the country. It was not just out of joy that the king
                  arranged the celebration. He could see that the prince
                  was depressed and that his new baby son was not giving
                  him happiness. The king was afraid Siddhartha was planning
                  to leave the palace for good and, for the last time, did
                  his best to distract him away from his sombre reflections
                  and back to the abundance of palace life.

                  The
                  prince attended the party just to please his father. During
                  the dinner the most delicious food was served, the most
                  enchanting and beautiful dancing girls in the country
                  performed, the most sensitive musicians played and
                  the finest puppets and magicians performed incredible
                  feats. But Siddhartha was so tired from thinking that
                  he soon fell asleep.

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  When
                  the singers and the dancers saw this they too stopped
                  and fell asleep. Some time later that night the prince
                  awoke and was shocked to see these sleeping people. What
                  a sight! All the prettiest, most charming dancing girls,
                  the finest singers, best musicians and cleverest performers
                  in the country, who, hours ago, were trying to make the
                  prince so happy, were now all over the floor of the room
                  in the most ugly, shameful and loathsome positions. Some
                  people were snoring like pigs, with their mouths wide
                  open, some grinding and chewing their teeth like hungry
                  devils. This alteration in their appearance made the prince
                  even more disgusted and unhappy. "How oppressive and stifling
                  this all is," he thought, and his mind turned again towards
                  leaving the palace. He got up quietly from the room and,
                  waking Channa, asked for his horse, Kanthaka, to be saddled.

                  As
                  Channa was preparing his horse, Siddhartha went quietly
                  to see his newborn son for the first time. His wife was
                  sleeping with the baby beside her, her hand resting on
                  the baby's head. The prince said to himself, "If I try
                  to move her hand so I can take the child for one last
                  cuddle I fear I will wake her and she will prevent me
                  from going. No! I must go, but when I have found what I
                  am looking for, I shall come back and see him and his
                  mother again."

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Quietly
                  then, Siddhartha left the palace. It was midnight, and
                  the prince was on his white horse Kanthaka with Channa,
                  his faithful servant, holding on to its tail. Nobody stopped
                  him as he rode away from all who knew, respected and loved
                  him. He took a last look at the city of Kapilavatthu &mdash;
                  sleeping so quietly in the moonlight. He was going away
                  to learn to understand old age, sickness and death. He
                  rode to the bank of the river Anoma ("illustrious") and
                  dismounted from his horse. He removed his jewellery and
                  princely clothes and gave them to Channa to return to
                  the king. Then the prince took his sword and cut his long
                  hair, donned simple clothes, took a begging bowl and asked
                  Channa to go back with Kanthaka.

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "It
                  is no use living in the palace without you, my master,"
                  said Channa very sadly, "I want to follow you." But Siddhartha
                  would not allow him to stay, although Channa asked three
                  times.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  At
                  last Channa started to go, but Kanthaka refused. The
                  prince talked to the horse very kindly. "Please, Kanthaka,
                  go with my friend. Don't wait for me." But Kanthaka thought,
                  "I shall never see my master again." Tears rolled down
                  from the horse's eyes as it kept them fixed on the prince,
                  until he turned to go away and walked out of sight. As
                  Siddhartha disappeared over the horizon, so Kanthaka's heart
                  burst, and he died of sorrow.
