                  After
                  many days of contemplation and distress, Siddhartha visited
                  the city for the fourth time. As he was driving to the
                  park he saw a happy man wearing an orange coloured robe.
                  He asked Channa, "Who is this man wearing an orange
                  robe? His hair is shaved off. Why does he look so happy?
                  How does he live and what does he do for a living?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "That
                  is a monk." replied Channa, "He lives in a temple,
                  goes from house to house for his food and goes from place
                  to place telling people how to be peaceful and good."
                  The prince felt very happy now. He thought, "I must
                  become one like that," as he walked through the park.

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  He
                  walked until he was tired, then sat under a tree to think
                  some more. As he was sitting under the cool shady tree,
                  news came that his wife had given birth to a fine baby
                  boy. When he heard the news he said, " An impediment
                  ("rahula") has been born to me, an obstacle
                  to my leaving has been born," and thus his son's
                  name became Rahula.

                  As
                  he was returning to the palace he met the Princess called
                  Kisagotami. She had been looking out of the palace window
                  and, seeing the prince coming, was so taken by his handsome
                  looks that she said loudly, "Oh! How happy must be
                  the mother, and father, and the wife of such a handsome
                  young prince!"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  As
                  he passed this woman, Siddhartha heard this and thought
                  to himself, "In a handsome figure the mother, father
                  and wife find happiness. But how does one escape obstacles
                  and suffering to reach nirvana (escape from suffering,
                  a lasting liberation which is happiness and genuine peace)?"
                  With this question he realised what he must do. "I
                  must quit this household life and retire from the world
                  in quest of enlightenment. This lady has taught me a valuable
                  lesson. I will send her a teacher's fee." Loosening
                  a valuable pearl necklace from about his neck, Siddhartha
                  honoured his word and sent it as payment to Kisagotami,
                  with thanks.
