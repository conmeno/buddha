                  During
                  the Buddha's lifetime there was a rich man who had
                  a charming daughter called Patacara. Her parents
                  loved her so much that they kept her in the seventh
                  storey of their mansion and did not let her go anywhere.

          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  When
                  she was sixteen, Patacara's parents made arrangements
                  for her to marry the son of another wealthy man.
                  But she had already fallen in love with her pageboy
                  and wanted to be with him.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Just
                  before the wedding, early in the morning, Patacara
                  dressed up like a servant and slipped out of the
                  mansion. She met her pageboy at an arranged place
                  and they ran away together.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  The
                  couple traveled to a faraway place and were married.
                  After some time Patacara was ready to give birth
                  to their child. "Here I have no one to help
                  me," she said to her beloved husband, "but
                  a mother and father always have a soft spot in their
                  heart for their child. Please take me to my parents'
                  house so I may give birth to our child."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  But
                  her husband said, "My darling, what are you
                  saying? If your mother and father were to see me
                  they would torture me to death. It is out of the
                  question for me to go." She begged him over
                  and over again and each time he refused to go.
              </font>
          </p>

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  One
                  day, when her husband was away, Patacara went to
                  her neighbours and told them, "If my husband
                  asks you where I have gone tell him that I have
                  gone home to my parents." When he came home
                  to find Patacara missing, her husband ran after
                  her and soon caught up, begging her to return home.
                  She began to refuse but right then her birth pains
                  started and she soon gave birth to a son. She thought,
                  "There is no point in going to my parents'
                  home now," and returned home with her husband.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  After
                  some time she was ready to give birth to her second
                  child and left for her parents' home again while
                  her husband was at work. Again her husband came
                  after her and begged her to return with him but
                  she refused.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  While
                  this was happening a fearful storm arose. Patacara
                  told her husband, "Dear, my birth pains have
                  come upon me. I cannot stand it, please find me
                  a place to shelter from this storm."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Her
                  husband took his axe and went here and there in the
                  heavy rain, looking for branches and leaves to make
                  a shelter. Seeing a bush growing on an anthill he
                  went to chop it down. As he did so a poisonous snake
                  slithered out and bit his hand, killing him immediately.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  As
                  Patacara waited for her husband, her pains became
                  more and more severe and soon she gave birth to
                  another son. Weak, cold and wet she could do nothing
                  more than place her children to her bosom, curl
                  into the ground and wait out the night, worrying
                  desperately after her husband and sheltering as
                  best she could.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Early the next morning, with the newborn on her
                  hip and holding the hand of the other child, Patacara
                  went along the path her husband had taken and eventually
                  found him lying dead. "All because of me my
                  husband died on the road," she cried.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  After
                  a while she continued walking along the path until
                  she came to the river Acirawati, which was flooded
                  from the storm. Since she felt weak from the previous
                  night she could not carry both children together.
                  Patacara placed the older boy on the bank and carried
                  the younger one across the river. She then put the
                  baby on a bed of leaves and returned for the older
                  child.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Hardly
                  had she come to midstream when a hawk came down
                  from the sky and swooped off with the young child.
                  Patacara saw the hawk and screamed in a loud voice,
                  "Su!, Su!" When he heard her voice across
                  the water the older boy thought, "Mother is
                  calling me." And, in a hurry to get to her,
                  he slipped down the bank and was swept away by the
                  river.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Now
                  Patacara became very distressed and cried and cried,
                  saying, "One of my sons has been carried away
                  by a hawk, the other swept away by the river, and
                  by the roadside my husband lies dead." She went
                  off weeping until she met a man and asked him, "Sir,
                  where do you live?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "In
                  Savatthi," he replied.
              </font>
          </p><p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "In the city of
                  Savatthi in such and such a street lives such and
                  such a family. Do you know them, Sir?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Yes,
                  my good Lady, but don't ask me about that family.
                  Ask me about another family you know."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Good
                  Sir, I know only that family. Please tell me about
                  them," said she.
              </font>
          </p><p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Since you insist, I cannot
                  hide the truth," said the man. "In the
                  heavy rains last night, the family's house collapsed,
                  killing all of them."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Oh
                  no!" cried Patacara.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Yes;
                  can you see that fire over there?" he asked,
                  pointing to some flames. "That is their funeral
                  fire."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  No
                  sooner had Patacara heard this than she fell on
                  the ground, rolling to and fro with grief. Some villagers
                  came and took her to the Jetavana monastery, where
                  the Buddha was teaching. The Buddha asked some ladies
                  to wash her, clothe her and give her food, and then
                  he consoled her in a most sweet and wonderful voice.
                  When she recovered her senses, and having gained
                  insight into her experiences, Patacara begged the
                  Buddha to ordain her. Thus Patacara became a bhikkhuni
                  (nun).
