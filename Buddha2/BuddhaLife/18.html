                  Following
                  this example, it is the custom of Buddhists to pay
                  respect to not only the original bodhi tree, but also
                  to the descendants of the bodhi tree that still thrive
                  today.

                  In
                  the third week, the Buddha saw through his mind’s
                  eye that the devas in the heavens were not sure whether
                  he had attained enlightenment or not. To prove his
                  enlightenment the Buddha created a golden bridge in
                  the air and walked up and down it for a whole week.

                  In
                  the fourth week, he created a beautiful jewelled chamber
                  and sitting inside it meditated on what was later
                  known as the "Detailed Teaching" (Abhidhamma). His
                  mind and body were so purified that six coloured rays
                  came out of his body &mdash; blue, yellow, red, white,
                  orange and a mixture of these five. Today these six
                  colours make up the Buddhist flag. Each colour represented
                  one noble quality of the Buddha: yellow for holiness,
                  white for purity, blue for confidence, red for wisdom
                  and orange for desirelessness. The mixed colour represented
                  all these noble qualities.

                  three most charming girls called Tanha, Rati and Raga
                  came to disturb his meditation. They danced in a most
                  seductive and charming manner and did everything to
                  tempt the Buddha to watch their dance. Yet he continued

                  came out and coiled his body seven times around the

                  weeks of fasting, two merchants came into his presence.

                  the Buddha rice cakes and honey to break his fast

                  These

                  became the first lay followers. There was no Sangha
                  (order of monks and nuns) then. They asked the Buddha
                  for something sacred to keep with them. The Buddha
                  wiped his head with his right hand and pulled out
                  some hair to give to them. These hair relics, called
                  Kesa Datu, were later reputed to be enshrined by
                  the merchants on their return home to what is now
                  known as Burma, in the Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon.
