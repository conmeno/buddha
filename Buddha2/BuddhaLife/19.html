          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Now the Buddha wanted
                  to tell other people how to become wise, good and
                  do service for others. He thought, "Now Asita,
                  Alara and Uddaka are dead but my friends Kondanna,
                  Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji are in Benares.
                  I must go there and talk to them."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Then he set out for Benares,
                  till at last he came to a grove where his five friends
                  were. This grove at Sarnath was called the Deer
                  Park. They saw him coming towards them and one
                  said to another, "Look yonder! There is Gotama,
                  the luxury-loving fellow who gave up fasting and fell
                  back into a life of ease and comfort. Don’t speak
                  to him or show him any respect. Let nobody go and
                  offer to take his bowl or his robe. We’ll just
                  leave a mat there for him to sit on if he wants to
                  and if he does not, he can stand. Who is going to
                  attend on a good-for-nothing ascetic like him."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  However, as the Buddha
                  came nearer and nearer, they began to notice that
                  he had changed. There was something about him, something
                  noble and majestic such as they had never seen before.
                  And in spite of themselves, before they knew what
                  they were doing, they forgot all they had agreed on.
                  One hastened forward to meet him, and respectfully
                  took his bowl and robe, another busily prepared a
                  seat for him, while a third hurried off and brought
                  him water to wash his feet.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  After he had taken a
                  seat the Buddha spoke to them and said, "Listen,
                  ascetics, I have the way to deathlessness. Let me
                  tell you, let me teach you. And if you listen and
                  learn and practise as I tell you, very soon you will
                  know for yourselves, not in some future life but here
                  and now in this present lifetime, that what I say is
                  true. You will realise for yourself the state that
                  is beyond all life and death."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Naturally the five ascetics
                  were very astonished to hear their old companion talking
                  like this. They had seen him give up the hard life
                  of fasting and consequently believed that he had given
                  up all efforts to find the truth. So initially they
                  simply did not believe him, and they told him so.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  But the Buddha replied,
                  "You are mistaken, Ascetics. I have not given
                  up all effort. I am not living a life of self-indulgence,
                  idle comfort and ease. Listen to me. I really have
                  attained supreme knowledge and insight. And I can
                  teach it to you so you may attain it for yourselves."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial">
                  Finally the five were
                  willing to listen to him and he delivered his first
                  teachings. He advised his followers to follow the Middle Way,
                  avoiding the two extremes of self-indulgence and self-torture.
                  For the first time he taught the
                  Four Noble Truths and how to practise the Eightfold
                  Path, the Noble Way that would lead to freedom from
                  suffering and to the way of enlightenment. With the conversion
                  of the five ascetics at the Deer Park at Sarnath,
                  the order of monks was established.
