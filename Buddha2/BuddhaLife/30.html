                  In
                  Savatthi there was a young man called Wakkali who
                  admired the Buddha's beauty. One day he thought,
                  "So long as I am living at home I cannot see
                  the Buddha, but if I become a monk I would see him
                  daily." So he went to the temple and was ordained
                  by the Buddha.

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Now
                  he had the opportunity to always admire the Buddha's
                  appearance. He did nothing all day but follow the
                  Buddha like a shadow. The Buddha waited for Wakkali's
                  wisdom to ripen, saying not a word. But instead
                  of reading, learning and meditating Wakkali just
                  admired the Buddha. The Buddha thought, "Unless
                  this monk gets a shock he will never come to understand."

          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  So
                  one day the Buddha had an invitation to spend the
                  three months rains retreat in Rajagaha and he left
                  Wakkali behind.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Wakkali
                  was very disappointed and began to think, "Three
                  months is a long time. What a miserable period I
                  will have to spend. What is the use of living any
                  longer? I will throw myself off Vultures' Peak."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Now
                  the Buddha, staying in Rajagaha, saw with his mind's
                  eye Wakkali about to jump off Vultures' Peak. "If
                  this monk gets no comfort or consolation from me
                  he will kill himself," he thought. The Buddha
                  immediately sent forth a radiant image of himself
                  and there, on the edge of the summit at Vultures'
                  Peak, Wakkali saw the Buddha before him and felt
                  his sorrow vanish. Wakkali's mind was filled with
                  joy and he thought, "The person who has perfect
                  faith in the Buddha will be full of joy and satisfaction.
                  The person who has perfect faith in the Buddha will
                  reach the place of peace and happiness."
