                  The
                  King of Kosala had an adviser called Bhaggawa. Bhaggawa

                  When
                  Ahinsaka was born, all the weapons in the country
                  shone brightly. The king was disturbed by this, and
                  the next morning he called his adviser to find out
                  the reason why the weapons were shiny. The adviser
                  said, "My wife has given birth to a son, Your

                  "Will he rob alone or with a gang?" asked
                  the king.

                  "He will be single-handed, Your Majesty,"
                  replied Bhaggawa.

                  "We should kill him now," said the king.

                  When
                  Ahinsaka was old enough his father sent him to a
                  school in Takka Sila. Ahinsaka was the strongest,
                  brightest and the most obedient child of all the
                  children in the whole school. Other children became
                  envious of him and behind his back made the teacher
                  hate him. Thus, when he had finished his education,
                  the teacher said, "Now you must pay me my tuition
                  fee."

                  "How
                  much should I pay, Sir?" asked Ahinsaka.

                  human fingers. And remember not to bring two right-hand human fingers from the same person."

                  Although
                  it was a most difficult thing for him to do, Ahinsaka
                  promised to pay his teacher. Taking a sword, off
                  he went until he reached Kosala.

                  Hiding
                  near a jungle highway, he waited for passers by.
                  He would rush out and kill them, cutting off a right-hand finger and hanging their corpses on a tree
                  for the vultures and crows. He made a garland out
                  of the finger bones and soon became known as "Angulimala"
                  (anguli=fingers, mala=garland).

                  Angulimala
                  went to another district and began to kill again.
                  Because he was murdering so many people, the King
                  of Kosala decided to go with his strong army and
                  capture the bandit. When Mantani heard this she
                  went to her husband to try to get him to save their
                  son.

                  "Darling,
                  he is very fierce now," said Bhaggawa. "He
                  may have changed completely, and if I go there he
                  may even kill me." But the mother was very
                  soft hearted and loved her son more than she loved
                  herself. She thought, "I must go to the jungle
                  myself and save him."

                  Now
                  Angulimala had killed 999 people. He had spent months
                  and months in the jungle without proper food, sleep
                  or comfort, so he was impatient to pay off his debt
                  and live a decent life. He thought, "Today
                  if even my own mother comes I will kill her and
                  cut off a finger to make one thousand fingers."

                  Now
                  that day, while the Buddha looked round the world
                  to see if anybody needed help, he saw Angulimala
                  and his mother. "I must save them," he
                  thought as he set out towards the jungle.

                  The
                  villagers, seeing the Buddha, cried out, "Teacher,
                  don’t go that way, it is too dangerous. Return
                  home quickly." Three times they warned him
                  but the Buddha continued, thanking them for their
                  concern.
              </font>

          <p>

                  Now
                  Angulimala’s mother entered the jungle. Angulimala
                  saw her coming and thought, "Poor lady. She
                  comes alone. I pity her but it cannot be helped
                  . I must keep my word and kill her." All of
                  a sudden, the Buddha appeared between them. Angulimala
                  thought, "It is very good that this ascetic
                  comes before my mother. Why should I kill her? I
                  will leave her alone and kill this stranger."
                  And with his sword he ran towards the Buddha. The
                  Buddha walked slowly before him, thinking, "Let
                  this young man see me running." So Angulimala
                  ran and ran towards the Buddha, but he could not
                  catch up with him. He became so weak that he could
                  not run any further. Then he shouted at the Buddha,
                  "Stop! Stand still!"

                  stand still, Angulimala! Do you also stand still?"

                  could not understand the meaning of the Buddha’s
                  words, so he asked him, "How can you say you
                  stand still while running faster than me?"

                  But you are merciless to living beings.<br>

                  was very pleased with what the Buddha said and throwing
                  away his sword knelt before him. The Buddha blessed
                  him and took him to the monastery, where he became
                  a monk.

                  to receive the Buddha's blessing before setting
                  out to the jungle. When the Buddha did not come,
                  he went to the monastery with his five hundred horses
