                  When
                  the Buddha had taken his evening meal that day, all
                  who knew him as Prince Siddhartha, except Princess
                  Yasodhara, came to talk to him. All of them were surprised
                  but happy to see their prince dressed like a monk.

                  Yasodhara
                  stayed in her room thinking, "Prince Siddhartha
                  is now the Enlightened One &mdash; the Buddha. He now
                  belongs to the line of Buddhas. Is it right for me
                  to go to him? He does not and cannot need me. I think
                  it is better to wait and see."

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  After
                  a while the Buddha asked, " Where is Yasodhara?"
              </font>

                  "She
                  is in her room," said his father."I shall
                  go there," said the Buddha and, giving his bowl
                  to the king, he went to her room. As he entered he said
                  to the king, "Let her pay me respect as she likes.
                  Say nothing."

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  As
                  soon as the Buddha entered the room, even before he
                  took his seat, Yasodhara rushed to him. She fell to
                  the floor, held his ankles, placed her head at his
                  feet and cried and cried until his toes were wet with
                  her tears. The Buddha kept quiet and nobody stopped
                  her until she was tired of crying. King Suddhodana
                  then said, "Lord, when my daughter-in-law heard
                  that you were wearing yellow robes she also robed
                  herself in yellow. When she heard you were taking
                  one meal a day she did the same. When she heard that
                  you had given up lofty couches, she lay on a low couch
                  and when she heard that you had given up garland and
                  scents she too gave them up. So virtuous is my daughter-in-law."

                  The
                  Buddha nodded and said, "Not only in this last
                  birth, O

                  king, but in a previous birth too, Yasodhara
                  was devoted and faithful to me."
