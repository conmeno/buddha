                  On
                  the third day after the Buddha's return to Kapilavatthu
                  he was invited to the wedding of Prince Nanda, his
                  youngest stepbrother, and his new bride, Princess
                  Janapada Kalyani. The Buddha attended the wedding
                  and celebrations, blessed them all, left his begging
                  bowl with Nanda and went away.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Nanda
                  thought, "I will go to the temple and return
                  the bowl." While he was there, Nanda and the
                  Buddha talked for a while before the Buddha said,
                  "Nanda, would you like to be a monk?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Yes,
                  Sir," said Nanda, and the Buddha ordained him.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Afterwards
                  Nanda, thinking of his beautiful bride, became very
                  sad and unhappy. "Why are you so sad, Nanda?"
                  asked the monks.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Brothers,
                  I am disappointed. I do not like this life. I want
                  to leave it and go home."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  The
                  Buddha then came to talk to Nanda. First the Buddha
                  showed him a she-monkey whose nose and tail were burnt
                  and fur singed and bloodied. "Do you see this
                  monkey, Nanda? Then take good note of her," said
                  the Buddha.

          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Then the Buddha showed Nanda 500 celestial nymphs.
                  "Nanda, do you see these nymphs?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Yes,"
                  answered Nanda.

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Who is prettier? The nymphs or
                  Janapada Kalyani?"

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Sir, as my bride is
                  prettier than the burnt monkey, so are the nymphs
                  compared to Janapada Kalyani."

                  Nanda, what then?"

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Reverend

                  case I shall take the greatest pleasure in living
                  the monk's life," said Nanda and he began to follow
                  the Buddha's teaching very carefully.
