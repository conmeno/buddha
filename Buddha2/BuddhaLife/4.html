                        the seventh day after his birth, Prince Siddhartha's mother 
                        died. The king had another queen, who was called Prajapati Gotami. 
                        She was the younger sister of Queen Maha Maya, and she 
                        had given birth to a son on the same day that Queen Maha 
                        Maya died. Prajapati Gotami gave her own son to a nurse 
                        and brought up Prince Siddhartha, whom she loved very 
                        much, as her own son. Prince Siddhartha could not remember 
                        his own mother.</font></p>

                        Prince Siddhartha was only a few years old, King Suddhodana 
                        sent him to school. There were many children in his class, 
                        all of them from noble families. His teacher was 
                        called Sarva Mitra.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
                        studied languages, reading, writing, mathematics, history, 
                        geography, science, and games like boxing, archery, wrestling 
                        and many others. He learnt all these subjects faster than 
                        any other pupil in his class. He was the cleverest in 
                        the class and the best at games. He gained distinction 
                        in every subject and became cleverer than his teachers. 
                        He was the wisest and the only one who asked many questions 
                        from his teachers and elders. He was the strongest, the 
                        tallest and the most handsome boy in the class. He was 
                        never lazy, he never misbehaved and was never disobedient 
                        to the teachers. He loved everybody and everybody loved 
                        him. He was a friend to all.</font></p>
