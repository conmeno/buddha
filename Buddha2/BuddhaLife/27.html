                  There
                  once was a boy by the name of Sopaka, born to a
                  very poor family. When this boy was only seven his
                  father died and his mother married another man who
                  was very wicked and unkind. His new stepfather always
                  beat and scolded small Sopaka who was very kind,
                  innocent and good.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  The
                  stepfather thought, "This boy is a nuisance,
                  a good-for-nothing, but I cannot do anything to him
                  because his mother loves him so much. What shall
                  I do about him?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  One
                  evening he said, "Dear son, let us go for a
                  walk."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  The
                  boy was surprised and thought, "My stepfather
                  has never talked to me so kindly. Perhaps my mother
                  has asked him to be kind to me." So he happily
                  went with his stepfather.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  They
                  walked to a cemetery where there were many rotting
                  bodies and the stepfather tied Sopaka to one of
                  them, leaving him alone and crying.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  As
                  the night became darker and darker Sopaka's fear
                  increased. He was alone in the cemetery and so frightened
                  that his hair stood on end and drops of sweat rolled
                  down his body. The noises of the jackals, tigers,
                  leopards and other wild animals made him even more
                  frightened. Then, when he was almost paralysed with
                  fear, he saw a shining noble-looking person with
                  a bright light coming towards him saying, "Sopaka,
                  don't cry. I am here to help you, so don't fear."
                  At that moment Sopaka broke his bonds and stood
                  before the Buddha in the Jetavana monastery. The
                  Buddha bathed him, gave him food to eat, cloths
                  to wear and consoled and comforted him.

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Meanwhile,
                  on returning home, the wicked stepfather was questioned
                  by Sopaka's mother. "Where is my son?"
                  she asked. "I don't know," he replied,
                  "he came home before me." But the mother
                  could not sleep the whole night for worrying about
                  her son.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Early
                  next day she went to see the Buddha for help. "Why
                  are you crying, sister?" asked the Buddha.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "O
                  Lord," replied the lady, "I have only
                  one son and since last night he has been missing.
                  My husband took Sopaka for a walk and the little
                  boy never returned home."
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Don't
                  worry, sister. Your son is safe. Here he is."
                  And so saying the Buddha showed her Sopaka, who had
                  become a monk. The mother was overjoyed to see her
                  son again, and after listening to the Buddha's teachings
                  she too became a follower.
