                  On
                  returning to the palace after seeing the sick man, Siddhartha
                  was very dissatisfied and depressed and was often seen
                  in deep thought. The king, seeing him so changed, became
                  very sad. Soon enough, the prince asked again for the king's
                  permission to leave the palace to learn more of life in the
                  city. The king agreed, as he knew there was nothing
                  to gain by trying to stop his son.

                  This
                  time, again wearing the clothes of noblemen, Siddhartha
                  and Channa went out from the palace and walked in many
                  parts of Kapilavatthu. After they had journeyed a good
                  part of the day, the prince saw a crowd of people coming
                  along the street crying, while four men at the back were
                  carrying a plank on which a very thin man lay flat and
                  still. The carried man was like a stone, never saying
                  a word. The crowd soon stopped and the plank bearers rested
                  the person down on a pile of wood and set the wood on
                  fire. The man did not move as the flames were burning
                  the plank, and then his body, from all sides.

                  "What
                  is this, Channa?" asked Siddhartha. "Why does
                  that man lie there so still, allowing these people to burn
                  him up? It's as if he does not know anything."

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "He
                  is dead," replied Channa.
              </font>
          </p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              <p>"Dead! Channa, does everyone die?"</p>
          </font>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Yes,
                  my dear prince, all living things must die some day. No
                  one can stop death from coming," replied Channa.

                  The
                  prince was so shocked he did not say anything more. He
                  thought that it was terrible that such a thing called
                  death should come to everybody, even kings and queens.
                  Was there no way to stop it? He went home in silence.
                  He went straight to his own room in the palace and sat
                  deep in thought for the rest of the day. Very sadly he
                  pondered, "Everyone in the world must die some day;
                  no one has found out how to stop it. There must be a way
                  to stop it. I must find it out and help the whole world."
