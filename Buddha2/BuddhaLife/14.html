                  After
                  leaving his second teacher, Uddaka, Prince Siddhartha
                  was known as Ascetic Gautama. He met five friends &mdash;
                  Kondanna, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji &mdash;
                  who had also left the palace and a life of luxury to
                  become ascetics, or students of life, living poorly.
                  They went to Uruvela and for six years Gautama struggled
                  and tortured his body while his five friends supported
                  and looked after him.

                  "I
                  will carry austerity to the uttermost," thought
                  Gautama. "This is the way to acquire wisdom."
                  He practised fasting, which was thought to be one of
                  the best ways to acquire wisdom. He lived on a grain
                  of rice a day, and later, nothing at all. His body became
                  so thin that his legs were like bamboo sticks, his backbone
                  was like a rope, his chest was like an incomplete roof
                  of a house, his eyes sank right inside, like stones
                  in a deep well. His skin lost its golden colour and
                  became black. In fact, he looked like a living skeleton
                  &mdash; all bones without any flesh! He suffered terrible
                  pain and hunger, yet continued to meditate.

                  Another
                  way of torturing his body was to hold his breath for
                  a long time until he felt violent pains in his ears,
                  head and whole body. He would then fall senseless to
                  the ground. During the full moon and new moon he went
                  out into the forest or to a cemetery to meditate, wearing
                  rags from graveyards and rubbish heaps. He became frightened
                  at first, especially when wild animals came, but he
                  never ran away. He stayed behind bravely in these dreadful
                  places, meditating all the time.

                  For
                  six long years he did these practices and in spite of
                  the great pain and suffering he did not find wisdom
                  or the answers to his questions. He finally decided,
                  "These austerities are not the way to enlightenment."
                  He went begging through the village for food to build
                  up his body. When his five friends saw this they felt
                  disappointed. They took their bowls and robes and left,
                  wanting nothing more to do with Gautama.
