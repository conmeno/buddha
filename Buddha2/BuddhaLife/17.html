                  The
                  Buddha had withstood the worst attacks of Mara. Finally, the
                  Evil One retreated and the terrible storm he had raised died
                  away. Now the mind of the Blessed One relaxed into peace.
                  The great darkness faded away and the full moon and stars
                  reappeared again.

                  The
                  Lord passed into a deep meditation, passing beyond the limits
                  of ordinary human understanding, seeing the world as it is,
                  and not as it appears to be. Like an eagle soaring effortlessly
                  toward the sun, his mind moved swiftly onward and upward.

                  He
                  saw his past lives and all his former births, with their good
                  and evil deeds, with their gains and losses. As his mind soared
                  upwards he saw the round of birth and death of all mankind.
                  He saw beings born repeatedly and dying according to their
                  karma.

                  Those
                  who do good actions have heavenly births. Though these lives
                  last longer than those on earth they also end in death, as
                  they are also subject to the law of impermanence. Those who
                  were suffering in the hell realms would also continue in the
                  round of rebirths. So all beings (except Buddhas) are caught
                  in the same round of existence, due to ignorance.

                  As
                  his vision became even clearer, he saw the so-called soul
                  of man, which man claims as his own, broken up into parts
                  and laid before him like the unwoven threads of a garment.
                  He saw the cause of the chain of existence &mdash; ignorance.
                  The ignorant person, who clings to things that are worthless
                  and transient, creates in him or herself more and more dangerous
                  illusions. But when desire dies, illusions end, and ignorance
                  vanishes like the night. Then the sun of enlightenment shines.

                  And
                  having understood the world as it is, the Buddha was perfected
                  in wisdom, never to be born again. Craving and destructive
                  desire had been completely eradicated &mdash; as a fire goes
                  out for lack of fuel.

                  in the brilliant light of all wisdom and truth sat the Buddha,
                  the Perfect One. And all about him the world lay calm and
                  bright and a soft breeze lifted the leaves of the bodhi tree.

                  At
                  the dawn after his enlightenment the Buddha uttered this verse:<br>

      <blockquote>

                  Seeking, but not finding, the builder of this house.<br>
                  Sorrowful is repeated birth.<br>
