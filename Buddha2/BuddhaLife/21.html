                  As
                  soon as he had 60 disciples the Buddha sent them
                  away to teach people everywhere. He left the Deer
                  Park and turned southwards towards the Magadha country.

                  Along
                  the way, on the banks of a river, there lived three
                  brothers whose names were Uruvela Kassapa, Nadi Kassapa
                  and Gaya Kassapa. Each lived with 500, 300 and 200
                  followers respectively.

                  One
                  evening the Buddha visited Uruvela Kassapa's hut and
                  asked, "If it is not an inconvenience, may I
                  spend a night in your kitchen?"

                  "I
                  don't mind, Great Gotama, but there is a fierce serpent
                  king in the kitchen. I am afraid it will harm you,"
                  said Uruvela Kassapa.

                  "Oh,
                  I don't mind," answered the Buddha. "If
                  you have no objection I will spent the night there."

                  The
                  Buddha went into the kitchen, spread some grass on
                  the floor for bedding, and sat down. The fierce serpent king,
                  hearing the noise, came slithering out of a hole in
                  the wall, opening his mouth to bite the Buddha."I
                  will not harm this serpent king. I will subdue him
                  by my love and kindness," thought the Buddha.
                  The angrier the serpent king became, the more kindly
                  and loving was Buddha. The serpent king could do him
                  no harm.

                  Early
                  next morning Uruvela Kassapa went to the Buddha and
                  found him sitting in deep meditation. The ascetic
                  was surprised and asked the Buddha whether the serpent king
                  had harmed him. "Here, see for yourself,"
                  said the Buddha and uncovered his begging bowl. Out
                  came the fierce serpent king and the ascetic started
                  to run away in fright. But the Buddha stopped him,
                  saying that he had a way to tame any fierce serpent.

                  "Can
                  I learn?" asked the ascetic. The Buddha then
                  gave his teachings and Uruvela Kassapa, his brothers
                  and all their followers became devotees of the Buddha's
                  Dharma.
