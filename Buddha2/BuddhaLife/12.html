                  From
                  the Anoma River, dressed as a beggar, the young prince
                  wandered from place to place. Eventually he came to
                  Rajagaha City, where King Bimbisara lived. With his
                  begging bowl in his hands Siddhartha walked round the
                  streets begging for food from door to door like any
                  other religious monk. People began to call him "Sakyamuni"
                  or sage of the Sakyas, others called him "Ascetic"
                  or "Ascetic Gotama", but nobody called him
                  Prince Siddhartha any more.

                  He
                  was most handsome, young, healthy, clean and neat. He
                  spoke very kindly and gently. He did not ask people
                  to give him anything but people were happy and pleased
                  to put some food into his bowl.

                  Some
                  people went and told the king. "Your majesty, there
                  is a young man. Some people call him ‘Ascetic Gotama’.
                  He is very clean, neat, kind, polite and not like a
                  beggar at all."

                  When
                  King Bimbisara heard the name "Gotama" he
                  knew at once that this prince was the son of King Suddhodana,
                  his friend. He went up to him and asked him, "
                  Why do you do this? Have you quarrelled with your father?
                  Why do you go about like this? Stay here and I shall
                  give you half of my kingdom."

                  "Thank
                  you very much, Sir. I love my parents, my wife, my son,
                  you and everybody. I want to find a way to stop
                  old age, sickness, worries and death. Therefore I am
                  going thus," said the Ascetic Gotama and off he
                  went.
