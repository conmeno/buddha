                  In
                  the evening after Sujata's lovely meal, Gotama went
                  to Gaya and looked for a suitable place to sit down
                  and meditate. He found a banyan tree and sat on its
                  east side, the side that was believed to be stable
                  and free from trembles and quakes. After sitting cross-legged
                  with his back towards the tree, he made this resolution:
                  "Though my skin, my nerves and my bones shall
                  waste away and my life blood go dry, I will not leave
                  this seat until I have attained the highest wisdom,
                  called supreme enlightenment, that leads to everlasting
                  happiness."

          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  He
                  meditated on his breathing in and breathing out. It
                  was the eve of the full moon. During the first part of the night
                  many evil thoughts, described as being like the evil
                  god Mara and his army, crept into his mind. Thoughts
                  of desire, craving, fear and attachment arose, yet
                  Gotama did not allow these thoughts to disturb his
                  concentration. He sat more firm than ever. He began
                  to feel calm and brave as he let these thoughts go
                  and so, in the first part of the night, he found the
                  power of seeing his own past lives.

                  In
                  the second part of the night Gotama realised the impermanence
                  of life and how living beings die only to be reborn
                  again. In the third part of the night he realised
                  the cause of all evil and suffering and how to be
                  released from it. He understood how to end sorrow,
                  unhappiness, suffering, old age and death.
