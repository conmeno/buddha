                  When
                  King Suddhodana came to know that the Buddha was teaching
                  in Rajagaha he sent nine messengers, one after the
                  other, inviting him to come to Kapilavatthu. All the
                  messengers became monks. They listened to the Buddha's
                  teachings and found them so appealing that they forgot
                  to convey the king's message.

              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  The
                  king had made arrangements for the Buddha to stay
                  in a park called Nigrodha. But when the Buddha did
                  not arrive, the king sent Kaludayi, a childhood playmate
                  of Buddha's, to invite him back to Kapilavatthu.

          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  When
                  the people of Kapilavatthu discovered that the Buddha
                  had come to their city they flocked to see him. Prince
                  Siddhartha's own relatives came as well and said,
                  "He is our younger brother, our nephew, our grandson."

          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  Then
                  the Buddha realised that some people, even then, did
                  not understand that he was already enlightened but
                  felt they were his elders. He showed them a miracle
                  called the "Twin miracle". Even the king,
                  seeing this miracle, worshipped him.

                  The
                  next day the Buddha took his begging bowl and went
                  from door to door begging for food. The king, seeing
                  this, was very annoyed. "Why do you disgrace
                  me, my son? Why do you ruin me like this? Why don't
                  you take food in the palace? Is it proper for you
                  to beg for food in this very city where you used to
                  travel in golden sedan chairs? Why do you put me to
                  shame, my dear son?"
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "I
                  am not putting you to shame, O Great King. This is
                  our custom," replied the Buddha calmly.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "How
                  can this be? Nobody in our family has ever begged
                  like this. How can you say 'it is our custom'?"
                  the confused king asked.
              </font>
          </p>
          <p>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  "Oh
                  Great King, this is not the custom of the Royal family,
                  but of the Buddhas. All the former Buddhas have lived
                  by receiving food this way.

                  However,
                  when the king begged the Buddha to take food in the
                  palace the Buddha kindly did so.
